\chapter{Methodology}\label{methodology}

This chapter outlines the research design, data collection methods, and analytical techniques employed in this study. The methodology is designed to ensure that the research objectives are met and that the findings are reliable and valid.


\section{Dataset Acquisition}

In this section explain how dataset used in the study has been acquired. If you have acquired the dataset from any repository link to that repository must be added and also provided in the citation section. Provide \href{https://example.com/record/2000}{\textcolor{blue}{hyperlink}} if necessary. 

Also, provide a slight description of the dataset and mention any data collection that is ongoing and what specific method you are using to collect the data.


\section{Dataset Details}

Provide details about your dataset. You can also provide a snapshot of sample data here to better explain your dataset.

Split your explanation into multiple subsection if necessary.


\subsection{Data Type 1}

Explanation of data type 1. Provide figure if necessary

    \includegraphics[width=.75\textwidth]{figures/demoFigure2.png}
    \caption{Demo Data Screenshot}
    \label{fig:dataDemo}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Data Type 2}
Explanation of data type 2. Provide tables and figures if necessary

You can write table here like this \ref{tab:numerical_data}.
\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Summary of Numerical Data}
    \label{tab:numerical_data} 
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{ID} & \textbf{Value 1} & \textbf{Value 2} & \textbf{Total} \\ 
        \hline
        1 & 10 & 15 & 25 \\ 
        2 & 20 & 25 & 45 \\ 
        3 & 30 & 35 & 65 \\ 
        4 & 40 & 45 & 85 \\ 
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{table}

You can also include table from external file like \ref{tab:sampleTable}
